##  Overview
This project leverages **Naive Bayes** to classify text or speech data into emotions such as **Joy**, **Anger**, **Sadness**, and **Surprise**. It includes data cleaning, TF-IDF feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and a user-friendly web interface powered by Flask.

---

##  Features
-  **Data Cleaning**: Preprocesses raw text or speech transcriptions to prepare for modeling  
-  **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes TF-IDF vectors to capture meaningful patterns  
-  **Model Training**: Trains a Naive Bayes classifier for emotion detection  
-  **Web App**: Flask-based interface (`app.py`, `templates/`, `static/`) for interactive predictions  
-  **Notebook Insights**: `model_training.ipynb` contains exploratory analysis and model evaluation visuals

##  Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Srinithimahalakshmi/Emotion_predictor.git
cd Emotion_predictor

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## Usage

### 1. Notebook Exploration & Model Training

Run the notebook for data analysis and model training:

```bash
jupyter notebook model_training.ipynb
```

### 2. Run the Flask Web App

Start the server to make predictions interactively:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open **[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)** in your browser, enter input, and let it detect your emotion!

### 3. Command-Line Testing

Use `test.py` to classify sample inputs and view predictions via the console.
